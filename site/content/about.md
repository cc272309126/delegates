# delegates

Passing around functions in functional languages like haskell or clojure is how you program in those
languages. Passing around functions in C/C++ is possible but more tedious. The syntax for function
pointers is quite daunting and relatively limited in it's application. For example it is not
possible to pass a member-function around.

*delegates* take care of some of the problems and allow to easily pass around and store "functions".
